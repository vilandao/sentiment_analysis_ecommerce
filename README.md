## Sentiment analysis - Women's ecommerce clothing reviews

### Context
Sentiment analysis is contextual mining of text which identifies and extracts subjective information in source material, 
and helping a business to understand the social sentiment of their brand, product or service while monitoring online conversations.

The purpose of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether or not a customer would recommend a purchased item of 
clothing based solely on the customer's written review.

### About the dataset
This dataset includes 23,486 rows and 10 feature variables (clothing id, age, review title, review text, item rating, recommended IND, positive feedback count, 
division name, department name, and class name). Each row corresponds to a customer review.

### Kernel content
The kernel is divided into 4 separate parts: 

     1. Import libraries and load the dataset
     2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): data imputation, variable analysis, and feature transformation
     3. Text preprocessing 
     4. Building sentiment classifier
